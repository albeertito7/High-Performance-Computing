# High-Performance-Computing

This repository contains the activities required during the subject *High Perfomance Computing* of the University of Lleida Master's Degree in Informatics Engineering.

This is a repository for PRACTISING, INSPIRATION and to review the solutions of a previous year, as they should not be the same.

Give me a star ‚≠ê if you find it useful. You can contact me if any question.

## Learning Objectives

* Knowledge the use of benchmarking tools applied to the high performance computing environments.
* Capacity for analysis and understanding the computer perfomance.
* Knowledge of the parallel programming paradigms.
